                <h2>Captain Cool of Indian Cricket</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</b> (born 7 July 1981) is a former Indian international cricketer who served
                    as the captain of the Indian national cricket team. Hailing from Ranchi, Jharkhand, Dhoni is known
                    for his exemplary leadership skills and calm demeanor on the field. He is considered one of the most
                    successful captains in the history of Indian cricket, leading the team to various victories,
                    including the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, and the 2011 ICC Cricket World
                    Cup. Under his captaincy, India also reached the top of the ICC Test rankings for the first time. In
                    addition to his captaincy, Dhoni is renowned for his exceptional wicket-keeping and finishing skills
                    as a batsman, earning him the nickname "Captain Cool."
